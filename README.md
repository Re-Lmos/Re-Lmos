##  Hi there, 🙋‍♀️   

My name is Renata Lemos. 
I am 26 years old, married with one child.
I am curious, communicative, proactive and always looking for new knowledge.
Currently I dedicate myself to the study of development and programming.
In my spare time I like to play video games, read and watch videos about self-knowledge, astrology and occult sciences.
Passionate about the universe, and the various possibilities that life has to offer. 
Living and learning ever.
